1.	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
A lot of the new design skills I gained related to understanding prebuilt programming functionality related to OpenGL.
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
Iterative.
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
OpenGL is the only prebuilt software so being able to learn and understand it applies to different ones too.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I was pretty consistent since day one. The biggest strategy that developed was how efficiently I was finding and applying resource textures.
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
Yes
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
It was largely the same in that I built upon each previous week’s work.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
A lot of my interests relate to robotics and self-driving technology, so understanding how 3D models are made is helpful.
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I feel like all the work I did with matrices and arrays will be applicable everywhere.
